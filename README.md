# Hi there! Welcome to the README for my portfolio.

For some reason, I've been afraid of making my portfolio.

I guess recreating website layouts were easier because all of the decisions into the layouts were already chosen for me, and it was overwhelming. **However**, I've combated my fear with researching design layouts I like, assembling desired color combinations, and picking out the fonts I'm going to be using. 

Making my portfolio is going to be a big step into my journey for web development, I'm excited. Stay tuned!
