# Hi there! Welcome to the README for my portfolio.

For some reason, I've been afraid of making my portfolio.

I guess recreating website layouts were easier because all of the decisions in the layouts were already chosen for me, and it was overwhelming not knowing what I wanted to do for my portfolio. However, I've combated my fear with researching design layouts I like, assembling together desired color combinations, and picking out the fonts I'm going to be using.

Making my portfolio is going to be a big step into my journey for web development, I'm excited. Stay tuned!
